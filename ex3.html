    <span id = 'first' class="js">JavaScript</span> (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),[8] often abbreviated as JS,
     is a high-level, interpreted programming language that
     conforms to the ECMAScript specification.   <span class="js">JavaScript</span> has
      curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based
      object-orientation, and first-class functions.

      <div>Alongside</div> HTML and <span>CSS</span>,   <span class="js">JavaScript</span> is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.[9]   <span class="js">JavaScript</span> enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it,[10] and major web browsers have a dedicated   <span class="js">JavaScript</span> engine to execute it.

    As a multi-paradigm language,   <span class="js">JavaScript</span> supports event-driven, functional, and imperative (including object-oriented and prototype-based) programming styles. It has APIs for working with text, arrays, dates, regular expressions, and the DOM, but the language itself does not include any I/O, such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. It relies upon the host environment in which it is embedded to provide these features.

    Initially only implemented client-side in web browsers,   <span class="js">JavaScript</span> engines are now embedded in many other types of host software, including server-side in web servers and databases, and in non-web programs such as word processors and PDF software, and in runtime environments that make   <span class="js">JavaScript</span> available for writing mobile and desktop applications, including desktop widgets.

    The terms Vanilla   <span class="js">JavaScript</span> and Vanilla JS refer to   <span class="js">JavaScript</span> not extended by any frameworks or additional libraries. Scripts written in Vanilla JS are plain   <span class="js">JavaScript</span> code.[11][12]

    Although there are similarities between   <span class="js">JavaScript</span> and Java, including language name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.   <span class="js">JavaScript</span> was influenced by programming languages such as Self and Scheme.[13]
